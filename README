I AM STILL DEVELOPPING IT. DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS YET!!

SCP(Simple Complex Processor) is a script language and its interpreter. To compile
it, do

git clone git@github.com:leo-tom/scp.git
cd scp
cargo build --release

You can read doc.html to know how this language works. Also reading documentation of
https://github.com/leo-tom/complex_plane may help you. This is a library used internally
in SCP.

ENJOY!!
